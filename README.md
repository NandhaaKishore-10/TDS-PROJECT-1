# Beijing GitHub Users with 500+ Followers
1.)I used the GitHub API to gather data on users in Beijing with over 500 followers by querying their profiles and fetching up to 500 of each userâ€™s most recent repositories. The script handled data cleaning, such as company name formatting, and saved results to CSV files for analysis.

2.)The most interesting and surprising finding is that a significant portion of top GitHub users in Beijing primarily work with open-source repositories in Python and JavaScript, with Python projects receiving a higher average star count. This suggests that Python may have a particularly engaged community among developers in Beijing.

3.)An actionable recommendation for developers is to focus on building and maintaining Python and JavaScript projects, as these languages have strong community support in Beijing. Additionally, including clear documentation and project roadmaps can help attract more followers and engagement, increasing the project's visibility and impact.
